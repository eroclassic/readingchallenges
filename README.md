# ðŸ“š Reading Challenge Website

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to create and track reading challenges. Inspired by **Almoturg's BookStats**, the platform enhances the experience by allowing users to generate challenges using dynamic queries (e.g., _"read a book for every year from 2000 to 2021"_) or custom book lists. Future enhancements include account creation, reading statistics, and visualizations to track progress.
